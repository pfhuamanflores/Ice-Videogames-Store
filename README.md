# Ice-Videogames-Store
In this project, I analyzed a dataset from Ice, an online video game store, to identify key patterns that determine a game's success. I explored various factors, including genre, user ratings, sales, release year, and platform. The goal was to discover trends and insights that influence a game's popularity and profitability, enabling better decision-making for future game releases and marketing strategies. I used Python for data analysis, cleaning, visualization and hypothesis testing.
